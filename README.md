# roaring-bitmap
Implementation of the roaring bitmap paper for learning purposes.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement basic roaring bitmap as mentioned in paper #1
- [ ] Add Run-Length Encoding support as mentioned in paper #2
- [ ] Add SIMD optimizations as mentioned in paper #3
- [ ] Compare performance with the naive bitmap on various workloads
